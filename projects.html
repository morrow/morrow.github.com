Javascript:  application powering a simple HTML site at morrow.github.com (just a skeleton now)
https://github.com/morrow/morrow.github.com/blob/master/js/app.js

that project's github
https://github.com/morrow/morrow.github.com

The url (no content, but a skeleton layout of my github page):
http://morrow.github.com

Javascript : application for loading web-pages asynchronously from a rails backend.  Uses the new HTML5 History API to load pages without refreshing and without using the "#!" hack.
https://github.com/morrow/Photog/blob/master/public/javascripts/application.js

HTML:
A very lean and simple HTML5 layout for that ajax application -- all of the main content is loaded asynchronously
https://github.com/morrow/Photog/blob/master/app/views/layouts/application.html.erb

The base repository (HTML is in app/views, css is in app/stylesheets):
https://github.com/morrow/Photog

The resulting page (A site I built for a client and friend's photography work -- still unfinished, but it will give a good idea of the concept):
http://photog.ind.fm 
http://photog.ind.fm/photos (the gallery)

Lots of javascript examples here:

Lots of python examples here:

Some node.js code here (useful for high IO applications -- chat, multiplayer games, etc.)

Python: Redis-backed CSS command line application
https://github.com/morrow/ind.fm/blob/master/private/code/python/scripts/css.py
This is a redis-backed application that allows you to write command-line CSS, so instead of opening up a text-editor, scrolling to line 1,523, hunting for the right attribute,
instead, you type into a shell:  style.command( selector, attribute, value),  for example: style.update( ".container", "color", "white") 
which will insert into the CSS file at the correct place: .container {   color:white; }.  You can also read values, delete attributes and selectors, and move them.

Most of the base ind.fm code was or will eventually be hooked up to the website here: http://ind.fm 

Some screenshots of the old design are attached, as well as some from an interface I designed for a CSS3 timer pomodoro timer application. 

Last but not least, what I consider to be a silly hack I made when Canadian ISPs announced they were going to charge insane rates for internet access.  Here's my description:
# This script loads reddit's front page via JSON ajax calls, minimizing page load size in exchange for a completely minimal interface.
# The average size of a reddit front page in my simple tests was ~430KB, whereas an average JSON call to the same page is a mere 29KB.
# The difference is actually smaller than that, since reddit likely caches it's static files, but a lot of the 430KB is HTML.
# This makes sense, it is faster to generate HTML server side and serve it than it is to generate it via javascript, however the point of
# this experiment is to see how minimal we can get the request size (this was inspired by the Canadian change to metered internet).
https://github.com/morrow/ind.fm/blob/master/public/code/cs/reddit.coffee
You can try it out for yourself if you'd like:  bookmark  this javascript , it will load reddit.com/static/ (reason being so we can make ajax calls to the reddit.com domain, without incurring a large download (403 file is small)) - you click it again and it loads the code.  Tested on webkit only.

Hope you were able to make some sense of all this -- I'm sorry I don't have a page together yet -- this will prompt me to make one.
